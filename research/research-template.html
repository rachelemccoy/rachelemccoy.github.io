<h1>Research</h1>

<p>Throughout my time at Carnegie Mellon University, I have participated in a number of research projects.  Below is a sampling.</p>

        <p>Spring and summer of sophomore year, I joined the Cohen-Karni group, which specializes is nanoelectronics for biointerfaces.  I started a project from square one with no graduate student heading the project, both rare for an undergraduate researcher.  This gave me the opportunity to design my own experiments and guide my own project.  I began by building an electrospinner, a device which uses electrical force to draw charged polymer solutions into nanofibers.  The goal was to first use this technique to produce a polymer-metal nanofiber composite, then anneal the composite to get just the metal and culture cardiac cells on the metal nanofiber substrate.  The first step proved to be difficult, as even slight variation in the electrospinning parameters yielded significant changes in the subsequently produced fibers.  Once the electrospinner was up and running, I spent 3 months running experiments and imaging and analyzing the fibers using SEM to produce the desired fibers.  Upon fabrication of the composite nanofibers, I partnered with a new graduate student in the lab to formulate a plan for ashing and annealing.  I passed the project off to him once we had a protocol in place.</p>

        <p>As part of a class on microstructures and properties of materials, we designed an experiment to test the results of recrystallization of a cold worked 70-30 brass sample. The goal was to show the relationship between grain size, temperature, and hardness.  We performed electropolishing, optical microscopy, and hardness testing on samples with a gradient in cold working and annealing temperature.  By comparison with the Rockwell hardness, we were able to determine the recrystallization temperature.  We used multiple techniques to find the grain sizes from the images, which were then analyzed to identify the trend that, as the percent cold worked increased, the average grain size decreased, and as the temperature increased, the average grain diameters increased.  A graph of the yield strength vs. grain size illustrated the Hall-Petch effect.  It was confirmed that grain size decreased with increasing prior strain and grain sizes followed an approximately log-normal distribution.</p>

        <p>In this project, we were asked to optimized the toughness of wood as an engineering material, looking particularly at oak and pine samples.  We decided to compare these specimens based on moisture content and dried a third of the samples in the oven, soaked a third of the samples in water, and kept the remaining samples as-received.  We performed charpy, tensile, and compression testing and compared across the different moisture contents.  In addition to moisture content, we took the direction of grain into consideration.  Overall, we found that higher moisture content leads to an increase in toughness, but a decrease in yield strength and maximum stress.</p>
