        <p>I am a senior at Carnegie Mellon University working towards a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering with a double major in Biomedical Engineering.  I am interested in the application of materials engineering to the design and development of consumer products.  Currently, I am working with my BME capstone team to design a hydraulic cardiac sleeve to apply torsion to the hearts of patients with congestive heart failure.  I have experience working on projects with materials ranging from wood to bronze on nano and macro scale, as well as biointerfaces and medical devices.</p>
